How to synchronize your Odoo Calendar with Google Calendar
==========================================================

Odoo is perfectly integrated with Google Calendar so that you 
can see & manage your meetings from both platforms 
(updates go through both directions).

Setup in Google
===============
- Go to `Google APIs platform <https://console.developers.google.com>`__ 
  to generate Google Calendar API credentials. Log in with your Google account. 

- Choose *Calendar API*.

- Create a new project and give it a name (e.g. Odoo). This project is needed
  to store your API credentials.

- Then you can create a Client ID.
  Enter the name of the application (e.g. Odoo) and the allowed pages on 
  which you will be redirected. The *Authorized JavaScript origin* is your 
  Odoo's instance URL. The *Authorized redirect URI* is your Odoo's instance 
  URL followed by '/google_account/authentication'.

- Go through the Consent Screen step by entering a product name 
  (e.g. Odoo). Feel free to check the customizations options 
  but this is not mandatory. The Consent Screen will only show up when you 
  enter the Client ID in Odoo for the first time.

- Finally you are provided with your **Client ID**. Go to *Credentials* to 
  get the **Client secret** as well. You will need both of them in Odoo.

- The setup is now ready. Open your Odoo Calendar and sync with Google.
  The first time you do it you are redirected to Google to authorize
  the connection. Once back in Odoo, click the sync button again.
  You can click it whenever you want to synchronize your calendar.
